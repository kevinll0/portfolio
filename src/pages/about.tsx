              Hi, my name is Kevin Grande âœ‹ and I'm a frontend developer. I became interested in web development when I was in higschool studying Software Development. At first, I was more interested in backend development, but as I started working on projects and building websites, I realized that I really enjoyed working on the frontend.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4">
              I started learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on my own and eventually started taking online courses and attending meetups to learn more. Then I got into college, and I got interested in how we can design systems taking in consideration the user's requirements. Eventually I decided to apply for an intership as a Frontend Developer, it was not an easy path at the beginning but as I was practicing I realized that it could be possible and it was.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4">
              Over the years, I've continued to develop my skills and stay up-to-date with the latest frontend technologies. I'm passionate about building beautiful and user-friendly interfaces and I love the challenge of solving complex problems with code.
